.SH _printf \[lq]19th April 2022\[rq] \[dq]_printf man page\[dq]
.SH Name: _printf \- a function that produces output according to a format that is passed to it
.SH Synopsis: #include\[lq]main.h\[rq]
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
int _printf(const char *format, ...);
\f[R]
.fi
.SH Description: The _printf function (which derives its name from \[lq]print formatted\[rq]) prints a message on the screen using a \[lq]format string\[rq] that includes the instructions to mix multiple strings into the final string to display on the screen.
.SH Options:
.PP
The _printf function returns the number of characters written.
If it returns a negative value it indicates that an error has occurred.
# FORMAT OF THE FUNCTION
.PP
The symbol \[lq]%\[rq] denotes the beginning of the format mark.
Every brand, therefore, begins with the symbol \[lq]%\[rq] and ends with
its type.
Each of the names (parameter, flags, width, precision, length, and type)
represents a set of possible values that are explained below.
Example:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
    _printf(\[dq]The value is %d.\[dq], counter);
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The %d mark is replaced by the value of the variable counter and the
resulting string is printed.
.SH TYPES OF FORMATS:
.SH c
.PP
The argument passed for specifier \[lq]%c\[rq] is of type int.
\[lq]%c\[rq] converts it to a unsigned char and prints a single
character.
# s The argument passed for specifier \[lq]%s\[rq] is a string in consta
char \f[I]. \[lq]%s\[rq] prints the string pointed to by the char \f[R].
# % The argument passed is not converted, it will only print a percent
sign \[lq]%\[rq].
To use this you must write \[lq]%%\[rq] (\[rs]%\ also works).
# i, d The argument passed is an int argument, \[lq]%i\[rq] or
\[lq]%d\[rq] do a signed decimal conversion of an integer.
.PP
Examples: len = _printf(\[lq]Let\[cq]s try to printf a simple
sentence.\[rq]); output: Let\[cq]s try to printf a simple sentence.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
_printf(\[dq]Negative:[%d]\[rs]n\[dq], \-762534);
output: Negative:[\-762534]

len = _printf(\[dq]Percent:[%%]\[rs]n\[dq]);
output: Percent:[%]
\f[R]
.fi
.SH Exit values:
.PP
The _printf function returns the number of characters written.

space, field width, 0 flag character, reverse, Rot13, and binary.
